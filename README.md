## Summary

Multi boxes selection is a Wicket widget. It uses [jQuery] (http://www.jquery.com) via [wiQuery] (http://code.google.com/p/wiquery). It is an input widget in a form of boxes. The users choose by clicking on the boxes and submit to make his choice final. The widget is configurable to accept minimum selections and prevent selections beyond the maximum limit.

This widget serves 2 purposes,

1) use as it is.
2) how-to for implementing Wicket components using wiQuery.
